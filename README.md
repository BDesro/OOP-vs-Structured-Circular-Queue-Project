This Project serves as both a comparison of the Object Oriented Programming and Structured paradigms, as well as my first solo GitHub repository.

<ins>Project Purpose</ins>:
  The project sees the creation of a circular queue using both structured and OOP to see the differences between the paradigms.

## *IMPORTANT TO RUN*
- If you are trying to use either the Structured or the OOP version, make sure to set the other main to main1 (or something other than main) so that there is no compilation conflict.


### Feel Free to Give Tips/Suggestions!
I am always trying to learn and improve, and this is my first repository. So don't be afraid to let me know if something could be done easier/better.

Thank you!
